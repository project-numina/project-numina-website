# Memo: Project Numina Editorial Workflow (Decap/Netlify CMS)

## Admin Access
- All editors with a GitHub account and repo access can log in to the admin at /admin/.
- Each editor can add, edit, or update content according to their GitHub permissions.

## Available Collections
- **Community**: manage team members, avatars, tags, etc.
- **Project Cards**: manage projects, statuses, images, descriptions, etc.
- **Blog**: manage news articles, announcements, etc.

## Editorial Workflow

### Community & Project Cards
- Any change (add, edit, delete) is saved and published directly to the GitHub repo.
- Changes are visible on the site after the next deployment.
- Use these sections to keep the team and project info up to date.

### Blog
- A "Draft" mode is available for each article.
- Create or edit an article, save it as a "Draft" for review or validation.
- When the article is ready, set it to "Published" to make it live on the site.
- This workflow allows you to prepare content in advance and publish at the right time.

## Best Practices
- Prefer using "Draft" mode for sensitive or to-be-reviewed content.
- All changes via the admin are versioned in GitHub (history, rollback possible).
- For questions or validation, use the status fields or communicate with the team.
