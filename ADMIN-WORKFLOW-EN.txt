# Memo: Project Numina Editorial Workflow (Strapi CMS)

## Admin Access
- The Strapi admin interface is accessible via the Strapi server URL (default: http://localhost:1337/admin in development).
- Editors must log in with their Strapi credentials to manage content.
- Changes are saved in the Strapi database and are immediately available via the API.

## Available Collections
- **Members**: manage team members, avatars, tags, etc.
- **Projects**: manage projects, statuses, images, descriptions, etc.
- **Articles (Blog)**: manage news articles, announcements, etc.
- **Community Photos**: manage team photos

## Editorial Workflow

### Members & Projects
- Any change (add, edit, delete) is saved in Strapi.
- Changes are immediately visible on the site via the Strapi API.
- Use these sections to keep the team and project info up to date.

### Articles (Blog)
- A "Draft" mode is available for each article via Strapi's draft/publish system.
- Create or edit an article, save it as a "Draft" for review or validation.
- When the article is ready, publish it to make it live on the site.
- This workflow allows you to prepare content in advance and publish at the right time.

## Best Practices
- Prefer using "Draft" mode for sensitive or to-be-reviewed content.
- All changes via the Strapi admin are accessible via the REST API.
- For questions or validation, use the status fields or communicate with the team.
- Images are managed via Strapi's media library system.
